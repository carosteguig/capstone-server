# Simple Meal

Simple Meal is a web app that helps people to simplify their meal planning and grocery shopping ritual. The idea was to create a very easy-to-use app that will provide recipes based around what ingredients the user already has in their pantry or is on sale at the grocery store.

My goal was to simplify grocery shopping and the mental load of meal planning while also providing a tool to reduce food waste. Using the same base ingredient(s) in multiple meals during the week will help to use the items before they expire, reducing waste and saving money.

The main focus was to design a User-Friendly and straightforward web app,  easy to use. Always aiming to create a good experience.

The web app is responsive, for mobile, tablet and desktop.
